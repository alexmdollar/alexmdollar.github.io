                <div class="aboutText"></div>
                <p>Originally from Indiana, I grew up with my mom, dad, brother, and a lovable corgi named Max. I was largely involved outside of school; primarily in tennis and music (mainly trombone, piano and guitar.)  From there, I went down to <span id='boldtext'>Indiana University</span> to pursue an eudcation in two fields of passion, coding and medical science.  During my time here, I was able to work in three field-related positions to bolster my educational growth. This included interships with <span id='boldtext'>ServeIT</span> and the <span id='boldtext'>IU School of Medicine</span>, as well as being an <span id='boldtext'>Undergraduate Instructor</span> for two different courses.</p>
                <p>Since college, I've been fortunate enough to be able to live in many different cities across America.  Firstly, I moved to Madison, Wisconsin for my first full-time job, <span id='boldtext'>Epic</span>. After two years of experience, I moved both companies and locations; working at <span id='boldtext'>Nextpoint</span> and moving to Milwaukee, WI.  Given the benefit of remote work; I've since moved to Nashville, TN and subsequently back home to Indiana!</p>
                <p>As you can probably tell I love to travel, but also enjoy sports, video and board games, and playing instruments (piano, trombone, guitar mainly.)  When not relaxing, I love creating websites and small random code projects to keep my coding skills sharp outside of work, and am working on a video game for fun!</p>

          <div class="workDesc">At Nextpoint I've utilized my coding background and experience at Epic to have a greater impact in the product Nextpoint provides, as well as push the team forward.  My main responsibility is keeping the app running smoothly; and resolving the hardest technical issues clients may face as quickly as possible.  At 6 months of employment I became the most tenured (and for a time, the sole member) of my team.  This became a huge challenge, both keeping clients of our application free of bugs and disruptions, as well as training new employees. This sink or swim scenario helped exponentially grow my skills technically (mainly with Ruby, Rails, and AWS), as well as grow my leadership and mentoring skills and has led me to make many processing changes to the team in areas of innefficiencies and pain points.

           <div class="workDesc">At Epic I partnered with a number of Cancer Centers across America; helping them troubleshoot the most difficult technical issues, develop new features, and fix bugs in the codebase.  Outside of direct client work, I identified and led key projects to push Epic's software further, and developed code that is used across all cancer centers on Epic. This led to an integrated knowledge of a hugely broad codebase, and my communication daily with analysts and end-users of all technological backgrounds gave me insight to all corners of technical support.

I partnered with a couple of organizations: with the City of Bloomington to create an interactive map application for locals, and for the Orange County Recycling Co-Op to create a website to maximize their community outreach.  Through these projects I practiced Laravel, PhP, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a practical and impactful way.

This included loads of back end work; from importing new data, maintaining current data, and training new interns to use OnBase and OnCore.  I also helped design surveys to send out to end users and discovered tactics to increase employee's efficiency as they made the switch from paper.
